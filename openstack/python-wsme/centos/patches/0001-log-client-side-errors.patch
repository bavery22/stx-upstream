Subject: [PATCH] change ClientSideError logging verbosity

Regression introduced in 16.10. Reverts the following
 upstream commit since WSME is used by SysInv-api to return ClientSideErrors,
 and in the case of CLI commands, no log history for such errors would be
 available.

Reverting commit 94cd1751c7b028898a38fda0689cfce15e2a96e2

    Change client-side error logging to debug

    A client-side error (that is something akin to a 4xx HTTP response
    code) is something that is common, it is not something that should
    cause WARNING level log messages. This change switches to using
    DEBUG so that it is easier to filter out the noisy messages.
