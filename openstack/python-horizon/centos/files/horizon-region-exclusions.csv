# This file is used by horizon to prevent specific regions from being
# populated in the region selector.  The contents of this file are a single
# CSV list containing the region names meant to be ignored,
# as shown in the example below (currently commented out).
#
# After modifying this file on the active controller, run the ‘sudo service horizon restart’ 
# command and then lock/unlock the inactive controller
#
# Note: ignoring this system's region is not supported
